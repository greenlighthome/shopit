* [√] Product update view for users to modify their products.

* [√] Change the structure from web_shop module;
        New: "Categories" menu-tab should contain a fixed amount of categories (CONSTANTS),
             "Market place" should take you to a view with the name of the categories as links,
             this categories are sub-classed in more specific item-categories (cell phones, video games, mp3 players, et-cetera).
* [√] Add custom style to registration html's

* [√] IMPORTANT: Add date field to Product model to keep track of products

* [√] Pagination for listing of products views (actual market view, actions, individual categories, and wherever needed)
